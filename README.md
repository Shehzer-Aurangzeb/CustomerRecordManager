# CustomerRecordManager

CustomerRecordManager is a Python-based application that uses the `socketserver` framework to manage customer records via a client-server architecture. The server reads customer data from a file and the client provides an interactive terminal menu for performing various operations on the customer records, such as finding, deleting, updating, and adding customer information.

**Note:** This is a practice project that I built to get familiar with python socket programming.
